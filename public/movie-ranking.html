<h1>His Majesty's selection on movies for competitive dominination motivation</h1>

<h2>Here are the top 3 that put me in a dominating mood</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>I chose Troy to be the first movie mentioned here for the sheer sophisticaion and talent of Achilles playedby Brad Pitt. His excellence in the battlefield especailly during his fight with Hector was inspiring in the sense of the pursuit of excellence. That alone was enough to be the first movie mentioned. </p>

<h3>Kuroko's Basketball: Last Game</h3>
<P>This is the movie version and seqeul to the hit anime sports show Kuroko's Basketball. The competitive nature of sport and the ruthlessness that comes with competing on the court is enough to make any competitor's blood boil with excitement. The need to compete and become stronger is as apparent in this movie as it was the the television seires.</P>

<h3>Justice League: Zack Snyder Edition</h3>
<p>Last but certainly not least, this movie was chosen primarily by Superman's complete domination in the film. Once the black suit was on during the final battle, Steppen Wolf never stood a chance. Nuff said.</p>

<h3>Bonus: Random Poem on Dominance</h3>
<p>
Wrath and raging thunder<br> 
A moment in eternity's time <br>
Render all empires of the earth asunder<br> 
As the New Sovereigns leave this world behind <br>
